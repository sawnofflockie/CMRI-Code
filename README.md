# CMRI-Code
<h1>Code used on various arduinos, to communicate over CMRI (RS-485), for sensors outputs etc.</h1>
<p>CMRI_Turnouts_and_Sensors_servo_bounce sketch is designed to be used on an Arduino Mega
and was initially based on the code developed by the Little Wicket Railway channel on YouTube.<p>
<p>However it has evolved somewhat, and inlcudes the facility to slow the servos down without having
to wait for them to complete their movement, as well as a simple signal bounce.</p>
<p>It will need further changes if using with more than a single point (turnout), but that will be done at a later date.</p>
<p>The other two files were used to test multiple nodes on a CMRI network, and will run on Arduino Nanos.</p>
